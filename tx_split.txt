* should never merge/assemble multi-exon transfrags just based on exon overlap 

* we split a transfrag joining two NEIGHBORING (spans non-overlapping) genes
   only if:
     * it has j overlaps in both genes
        OR j in one, k|m|n in the other
  AND  
     * transfrag spans at least half of each ref gene span

?? AND it has a novel junction?
