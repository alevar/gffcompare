## GffCompare usage example

The program GffCompare can be used to compare, merge, annotate and estimate 
accuracy of one or more GFF files (the *query* files), when compared with a 
reference annotation (also provided as GFF or GTF). 

A basic command line to compare a GTF file to a reference annotation is:
```
gffcompare -r annotation.gff transcripts.gtf
```

The reference annotation is specified in the `annotation.gff` file and 
`transcripts.gtf` represents the query file being investigated (more than 
one query file can be provided). Unless the `-o` (output prefix) option was provided, 
the output will be found in multiple files with the prefix `gffcmp.`.

For more information about the output files please see the GffCompare manual
available at https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml

The `output` directory in this repository or archive contains the 
output files that should be generated by the above command.
